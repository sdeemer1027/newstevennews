    <h3>This is where the video will play</h3>
    <p>My name is Steve, My Family Tree traces back to the McCoy's of the Hatfield and McCoy </p>
    <p>Not everyone is familiar with this family feud, but it is a good story. Especially when it was told by my Grandmother</p>
    <p>
    I will outline more details over time but for now I happen to come by the mini-series a three part movie I am here sharing with those who seem interested.
    This is especially for my family to watch the three sections are in the menu and this is best displayed on a monitor or laptop.
        Currently I have it setup as a shared file on my google drive and stream it to your device...
        <BR><BR>
        Enjoy
